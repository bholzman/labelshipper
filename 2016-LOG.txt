Here's what I did to get labelship reports run for 2016.

1) add new accounts from spreadsheet thomas sent
  - requires updating etc/accounts.csv directly, ***should make this easier***
  - wanted to add support for a header to at least self-document the file
  - so wanted to get coninuous integration running
  - updates to python on my laptop broke some tools the tests relied on
  - had to upgrade xcode to fix this
  - had to fix various formatting issues in the source code to get ci running
  - finally added new accounts by hand
  - also audited status of existing accounts by hand

2) add in 2016 direct sale, stock correction and ledger items spreadsheets
  - reformat stock correction CSV (and negate counts -- stock out is positive number) to:
    YYYY.MM.DD,ACCOUNT,CD CORRECTION,VINYL CORRECTION,0,"stock correction",,DESCRIPTION
    (did this in sheets, downloaded as CSV)
  - reformat direct sale spreadsheet (and negate counts) to:
    YYYY.MM.DD,ACCOUNT,CD,VINYL,EUR (converted other currencies),sale,"Labelship direct sale",DESCRIPTION
  - reformat artist transaction spreadsheet to:
    YYYY.MM.DD,ACCOUNT,0,0,EUR (converted other currencies),TRANSACTION,Labelship,DESCRIPTION

3) Update balances from 2015 final
  - ***add feature to update this automatically***

4) download brokensilence statements, verify format
  - new "summary physical sales" section broke parser
  - extended it to read in data, but not using it for anything (yet?)

5) added brokensilence CD/LP codes for new products

6) run reports:
  - python artist-reports --bs brokensilence/2016*.csv --direct direct/2016*.csv
    - had to pad all ACCOUNT numbers in direct/2016*.csv with extra 0 (e.g. LS00029, not LS0029)
    - add logic to handle blank lp/cd counts
    - commented out "expected stock count" logic, since it no longer applies
